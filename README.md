## A small, Rick and Morty based js excercise
use https://rickandmortyapi.com/documentation/#rest as a reference

```sh
git clone git@github.com:AHDesigns/Quick-rick-and-morty-excersie.git
cd quick-rick-and-morty-excersie
npm i
npm start dev
```

From index.js
```js
/* TODO
 * using the rickandmortyapi, find out every episode Rick has
 * appeared in, and then, making the assumption that he met
 * every character in each episode, get a list of all the
 * characters Rick met.
 * return the results as an array of names, without duplicates
 */
```

### Extra points
Ignore any characters met on on the `Citadel of Ricks`
